Testing calligraphic elements in an Arabic internet page

In the hope of improving the typographic quality of Arabic internet pages, this example uses new web fonts developed for the BBC Arabic website and also used in their broadcast.

The page also demonstrates the use of calligraphic elements generated by an online Arabic calligraphy service at https://kaleam.com.

It is hoped that the contrast between the two script items contributes to the aesthetic appeal of the resulting pages.

The page itself contains links to the various resources used and mentioned in the content.
